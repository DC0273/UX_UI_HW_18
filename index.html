                    <h2>User Research</h2>
                    <p id="URtext">I first like to start by completing heuristic 
                    research, then create surveys and interview 
                    questions based on that research. From the 
                    findings I’ll analyze the data into an affinity 
                    diagram and an empathy map, then define 
                    the problem(s) and a user persona(s).
                    
                    For this process I’ll use tools such as; POST-
                    IT NOTES!!, Miro, Google Forms, Adobe XD, 
                    Figma</p>

                    <h2>Concept Scenarios</h2>
                    <p id="CStext">After creating a user persona I’ll create user 
                    scenarios, through well thought-out journey 
                    maps and story boards, for stakeholders to 
                    find empathetic and very much relatable 
                    from a user’s perspective. 
                    
                    For this process I’ll use tools such as; 
                    UXPressia, Adobe Creative Suite, Figma</p>

                    <h2>Ideation and Testing</h2>
                    <p>Now this is where the fun begins. Producing 
                    ways to solve the problem! During this phase 
                    I’ll start with a “I Like, I Wish, What if” 
                    board, a Feature Prioritization Matrix, and a 
                    Competitor Analysis. With a solution to the 
                    problem, I like to validate the solutions by 
                    continuing user research through surveys. 
                    Next, I’ll create a user flow and begin 
                    mocking up wireframes and create a 
                    clickable prototype. Here I would test and 
                    iterate my design OFTEN! 
                    
                    For this process I’ll use tools such as; MORE
